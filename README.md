# 🎭 Playwright Initial Project With BDD

This repository contains my first complete automation framework using **Playwright** and **Cucumber** for **BDD** approach.  
It includes the full migration of the tests from my previous Playwright-only project [playwright-initial-project](https://github.com/BernardoSJ/playwright-initial-project), it follows all the best practices applied such as a **Page Object Model (POM)** architecture and also using Gherkin language to follow the right Cucumber sintax.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

Run the following commands in your terminal:

1. **Clone or download the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BernardoSJ/playwright-initial-project-bdd.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project folder and install dependencies (only the first time):**
   ```bash
   cd playwright-initial-project-bdd
   npm install
   ```
3. **Run tests without specifying a browser**
   ```bash
   npm run cucumber
   ```
4. **Execute specific test suites within a specific browser by tag(e.g., @cart, @checkout, @inventory) and browser(e.g., cucumber:chromium)**
   ```bash
   npm run cucumber:chromium -- --tags @checkout
   ```

## ⚙️ GitHub Actions CI

This project includes a **GitHub Actions** workflow to run Playwright tests in CI.
* Workflow name: **Playwright E2E Cucumber**.
* Triggers: 
   * **workflow_dispatch**.
   * **push** to main.
   * **pull_request** to main.
* **PRs** executes only @checkout faster in chromium.
* **Push/manual** matrix for browser (**Chromium**, **Firefox**, **WebKit**).
* **Artifacts**:
   * **HTML report** reports/cucumber.
   * On failure after retry: **trace.zip** and **video.webm** (from test-results/**)


## 📊 Cucumber BDD Reports

Every cucumber execution automatically generates:

* Console output with "progress" format
* HTML Report Under:
   ```bash
   reports/cucumber/index.html
   ```
* JSON Report Under:
   ```bash
   reports/cucumber/report.json
   ```

## ✅ Current Test Coverage

**Implemented modules using Gherkin language:**
* **Login**
* **Inventory**
* **Cart**
* **Checkout (data-driven)**

## 🧪 Network Mocking (page.route)
This repo includes a didactic example using page.route to intercept and fulfill a JSON response, demonstrating network control without a real backend.

**Run only the mock test:**
```bash
npm run cucumber:chromium -- --tags @mock
```

## 🧠 Key Concepts Applied

* Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) using Cucumber + Gherkin language.
* Modular Page Object Model (POM) for maintainability and reusability.
* Custom World implementation for sharing Playwright context, browser, and page.
* Browser parametrization via environment variable (chromium / firefox / webkit).
* Steps with clean responsibilities.
* Backgrounds for scenarios with initial common state.
* Scenario Outlines + Examples for data-driven tests.
* Dynamic test data generation using Faker.js.
* Network mocking with page.route.
* Explicit sync via expect() instead of manual waits.
* Isolated scenarios (no dependencies among features, neither steps).
* HTML + JSON report generation included in every run.
* Code formatting & linting using Prettier.
* Consistent naming conventions for steps, POM, and features.

## ⚠️ Limitations & Considerations

* Playwright does not natively integrate Cucumber—the runner used is pure Cucumber and requires additional configuration.
* Cucumber does not parallelize scenarios by default (unless external runners or multiple jobs in CI are added).
* Some features of Playwright's native runner are not available here:
    * No "test.steps()"
    * No advanced fixtures
* Handling trace/video requires additional code in hooks.
* Network mocking with "page.route" does not bypass CORS restrictions.
* "page.route" only intercepts browser traffic, not calls from the backend.
* Executions may be slightly slower than with "@playwright/test" due to Cucumber overhead.
* Step autocompletion in TypeScript is more limited compared to Playwright Test Runner.
